  "overview": "Handyman Saito has never been anyone special. All his life, he’s had average grades, ordinary athletic skill, a commonplace job… But his unremarkable path takes a turn when he wakes up in another world. Here, warriors, wizards, and elves accompany him on quests delving deep into dungeons, and Saito realizes for the first time what it’s like to be needed. After all, who other than the handyman could be trusted to open locked treasure chests or repair his allies’ equipment? Beginning with a simple “thank you,” this is the story of an ordinary person’s fulfilling life.",
